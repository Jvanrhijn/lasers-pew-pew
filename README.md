# Lasers, PEW PEW!

Lasers, PEW PEW! is a small game in MATLAB, written for the University of Twente course
"Programming in Engineering". The objective is to manipulate various reflective, refractive and
absorbent objects in order to hit a target with a laser. In this way, the game teaches users about
concepts of [geometrical optics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometrical_optics) in a playful fashion. 

The simplistic ray tracer implements refraction and both external and internal
reflection.

### Requirements

* Matlab R2018a or newer.

### Usage

Call the `main` script from the MATlab command window:

```
>>> main
```

If the game does not perform well (e.g. freezes regularly, doesn't capture input), lower the
refresh rate using the slider in the main menu.

Quit the game by pressing any key during gameplay.
