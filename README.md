# Lasers, PEW PEW!

Lasers, PEW PEW! is a small game in MATLAB, written for the University of Twente course
"Programming in Engineering". The objective is to manipulate various reflective, refractive and
absorbent objects in order to hit a target with a laser. In this way, the game teaches users about
concepts of [geometrical optics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometrical_optics) in a playful fashion. 

The simplistic ray tracer implements refraction and both external and internal
reflection.
